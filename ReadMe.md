# Problem ⚡⚡:
### Create a web version of the popular british game, The Simon game. 🎲🎲

## About project:
This project was basically to test my javascrip DOM manipulation skills. 

## How to play:
This is primarily a pattern remeberance game.


This game is in such a way that there are four boxes.


Each box is a different color. 


The game starts with a "Press any key to play" heading. 


Once you've done this, a box(with a particular color) is highlighted, and the highlight fades after a milisecond. 


This represents the first pattern. 


You are to click on the box that was highlighted. 


You have succesfully remembered the first parttern.


The game highlights another color....


But remembr, it's all about patterns 😜😜


If you click on the next highlighted pattern, you fail! 😭😭😭 (I learnt this the hard way).


Because this is a game of patterns, you have to remeber the first color(box) that was highlighted, and start from there. 


### Example: 
The patterns show up in this order
[Blue] 1st highlight:
play [blue 🔵]

[Red]  2nd highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴]

[Green] 3rd highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢]

[Blue]  4th highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵]

[Green] 5th highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢]

[Red]   6th highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢][red 🔴]

[Yellow] 7th highlight
play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢][red 🔴][yellow 🟡]
.....

The game keeps going on in a continous loop until you miss a pattern and then it restrats.
