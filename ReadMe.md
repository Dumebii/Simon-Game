# Problem ⚡⚡:
### Create a web version of the popular british game, The Simon game. 🎲🎲

## About project:
This project was basically to test my javascrip DOM manipulation skills. 

## How to play:
This is primarily a pattern remembrance game.

This game is in such a way that there are four boxes.

Each box is a different color.

The game starts with a "Press any key to play" heading.

Once you've done this, a box(with a particular color) is highlighted, and the highlight fades after a millisecond.

This represents the first pattern.

You are to click on the box that was highlighted.

You have successfully remembered the first pattern.

The game highlights another color...

But remember, it's all about patterns 😜😜

If you click on the next highlighted pattern, you fail! 😭😭😭 (I learned this the hard way).

Because this is a game of patterns, you have to remember the first color(box) that was highlighted and start from there.

Example:
The patterns show up in this order [Blue] 1st highlight: play [blue 🔵]

[Red] 2nd highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴]

[Green] 3rd highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢]

[Blue] 4th highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵]

[Green] 5th highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢]

[Red] 6th highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢][red 🔴]

[Yellow] 7th highlight play [blue 🔵][red 🔴][green 🟢][blue 🔵][green 🟢][red 🔴][yellow 🟡] .....

The game keeps going on in a continuous loop until you miss a pattern and then it restarts.
